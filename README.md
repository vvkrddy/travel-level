### Instructions to use

- Click on any region to show clickable categories for selection.
- Scroll-zoom is available for the world map only. This is useful to find and click on smaller regions.
- On zooming, to get back to initial zoomed-out layout, click on RESET MAP button. This does not reset selection.
- If you are unable to find a region on map, please let me know. It could be possible that the border could be wide enough that the enclosed region is not visible anymore.

> It is a geography exercise as the names of regions are not shown until a user clicks on it.
